/**
 * Gradebook "grade analysis" redirect for mod_exelearning.
 *
 * The Moodle gradebook links the per-grade "grade analysis" entry to this script,
 * passing the clicked item's `itemnumber` (and `userid`). Shipping this file is also
 * what makes that link appear (same as core mod_scorm / mod_h5pactivity). The
 * destination is role-based (issue #13 #4, DEC-0023/DEC-0028): teachers/graders get
 * the attempts report (the actual attempt behind the grade); students are deep-linked
 * to the specific iDevice in the content. The gradebook column header itself is fixed
 * by Moodle core to view.php and cannot be deep-linked by a plugin.
