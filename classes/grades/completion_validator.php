 * Completion-by-grade form validation relaxation for mod_exelearning.

 * mod_form.php delegates through the thin lib.php wrapper. Kept as a pure
 * function (no moodleform_mod coupling) so it stays unit-testable, as the
 * original PHPDoc (B7, DEC-0044) describes.

     * Relaxes core's "completion grade item has no grade field" validation error for a
     * registered gradable item (B7, DEC-0044).
     *
     * Core's moodleform_mod::validation() rejects every completiongradeitemnumber with a
     * badcompletiongradeitemnumber error (key 'completionpassgrade') because
     * mod_exelearning maps 101 itemnumbers (gradeitems::MAX_ITEMNUMBER) but stores each
     * grade in its own table instead of exposing per-itemnumber grade_ideviceN form
     * fields — so core's "this item has no grade field" check always fails, making the
     * DEC-0038 completion-by-grade feature impossible to save from the form. This
     * stopgap clears that specific error when "require passing grade" is OFF and the
     * chosen item is a real gradebook column (a per-iDevice item in PERITEM, or the
     * overall in OVERALL): it does carry a grade, just not via a core form field.
     * Because it only fires when completionpassgrade is unchecked, it never masks the
     * legitimate "grade to pass not set" validation. "Require passing grade" needs a
     * core_grades fieldname_mapping to validate the threshold and is left to that proper
     * fix (deferred). Kept as a pure function so it is unit-testable without building the
     * whole moodleform_mod (which couples to core availability/tags/completion fields).

     * @param array $data The submitted form data.
