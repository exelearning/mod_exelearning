/**
 * Batch gradebook recalculation from the stored attempt history.

 * Extracted verbatim from lib.php (DEC-0054). The aggregation/publish logic is
 * unchanged — it still respects grademethod (DEC-0007) and the grademodel column
 * rules (PERITEM has no overall column DEC-0038; OVERALL has no per-iDevice
 * columns DEC-0008) — and issues exactly one grade_update() per itemnumber with
 * grades keyed by userid (the batched, no-N+1 path from DEC-0049 #006). lib.php
 * keeps thin delegators with the original `exelearning_*` signatures.
