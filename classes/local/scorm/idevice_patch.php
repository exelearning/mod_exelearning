    /**
     * Drop the `body.exe-scorm` condition from the score-save guard of the `form` and
     * `scrambled-list` iDevices in the extracted package (issue #13).
     *
     * eXeLearning's `exe-scorm` body class is its "running as a SCORM export" switch.
     * The web/elpx export we serve does not carry it, and 49 of 51 iDevices either do
     * not touch it or only use it to load the SCORM wrapper (which we already inject).
     * Only `form` and `scrambled-list` put `body.hasClass('exe-scorm')` in front of
     * their `sendScore()` call, so they never persist their score here — their
     * cmi.suspend_data entry stays at the seeded 0 (the gradebook shows 0).
     *
     * Rather than add `exe-scorm` to the body (which would also switch on the SCO page
     * lifecycle and the SCORM presentation CSS), we apply the same one-line change
     * upstream describes (exelearning/exelearning#1925) at serve time, only to these
     * two save guards, so they behave like every other gradable iDevice (save on
     * `isScorm > 0`). The patch targets the unique `data.isScorm` variant of the guard
     * (the init-time guards use `ldata.isScorm`), is idempotent (the matched string is
     * removed), and degrades safely: if a future producer reformats the guard the
     * replace is a no-op and behaviour reverts to today's. See research ADR DEC-0042.
